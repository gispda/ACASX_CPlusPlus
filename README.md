ACAS X for aircraft collision avoidance using Markov Decision Process (MDP), Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) and Dynamic Programming.


The FAA has funded research and development of a new approach to airborne collision avoidance (provisionally known as ACAS X) since 2008. This new approach takes advantage of recent advances in ‘dynamic programming’ and other computer science techniques (which were not available when TCAS was first developed) to generate alerts using an off-line optimisation of resolution advisories. It is the intention that ACAS X will eventually replace TCAS II (ACAS II).

For more information about ACAS X, please see this introduction paper.

For Java implementation (in 3D), you can also find it from my Github.
